    <h2>The Origin Of Evil - The Legend Of Narcissus And Oedipus</h2>
    <p>A full scale symphonic poem of 1 hour and 38 minutes length composed in 3 Acts and 21 movements ! This symphonic poem has a continuous dramatic progression trough the whole work. The symphonic poem starts with joyful pieces, then the trigger event happens, and the more the listener advances in the listening of this work, more dark and violent get the themes until the ultimate dramatic climax of the Act III. This work has a great narrative quality as well as its musical one. It has also deep philosophical and political meaning.
Since my album is a symphonic poem, it means it has an underlying story. Here is a brief synopsis of the story behind ''The Origin Of Evil - The Legend Of Narcissus And Oedipus'' .
The story begins in a small village, just at the Western border of the huge jungle that separates the continent in two separate parts, Western and Eastern. A group of five friends, a warrior, a knight, a hunter, a writer and a violinist bard are celebrating the yearly Spring Festival. At the time of the sunset, lightning strikes in the middle of the village coming from nowhere. Out of the lightning, a strange character appears and addresses to the five friends mentioned earlier. He says he's the messenger of the absolute Evil, and that the 5 friends have for duty to cross the whole continent to warn their King that a gigantic army of undead creatures led by an evil sorceress named ''Morgana Nibelung'' are currently marching towards the capital city. The villagers leave no choice to the adventurers and tell them to leave the village by the sewers, the only direct way to the jungle that separates the continent. They get in the sewers, trough the jungle, and finally reach the other side of the jungle after one month of travel. Once they arrive, they have a direct look at the army of undead creatures, and it is enormous. They rush their way towards the capital city, and midway, they meet with the King's army, which have been warned before they arrived of the coming of the undead creatures army. Then follows an epic battle, and our adventurers succeed to defeat the undead and Morgana Nibelung, but the writer is mortally wounded and dies a few minutes after the battle ends. After this, the adventurers bury their friend. At the end of the burial, in the graveyard, when only our adventurers are left, the Evil's Messenger shows back. He tells the adventurers he offers them a chance to bring their friend back to life. In order to save their friend they will have to follow him into Hells, and cross the three main parts of Hells, representing the three pillars of Evil and Hells. Death, Pathological Lying, and Torture. Our adventurers successfully cross all of the Hells, and finally get in front of a horrifying Gate. It is the Gate of the Archdevil's palace. The Evil's Messenger waits for them just in front of the Gate, and gives the bard a pile of sheet music titled Brutal Death Symphony. He tells the bard, in order to save their friend, he must defeat the Archdevil, by playing the most difficult violin concerto ever written while the Archdevil and its servants try to kill him and the three other adventurers. The Evil's Messenger opens the Gate, and our adventurers enter the palace.</p>
    
<h3>I will keep the outcome of the fight between the four remaining adventurers and the Archdevil a secret until my album reaches at least 1 million downloads of the MP3 format album. Then I will reveal the outcome of the outcome of this epic final confrontation and how Narcissus and Oedipus are tied to the real origin of Evil and the Archdevil. So, if you want to know the end of the story, you have two options. Either you share the album until it reaches 1 million downloads of the MP3 format album, or you read The Origin of Familly, Private Property and the State, by Frederich Engels in order to deduce the end by yourself.</h3>

<h2>Good luck everyone ! Welcome to Hells !</h2>
